Framework for Ethical Reasoning in Autonomous Systems

In order for autonomous systems to contribute constructively to society there is a need for coming up with an objective definition of 'character'.
The framework for ethical reasoning attempts at building a character for an autonomous system (bot). The main APIs within this framework would be as follows:
 
 - Purpose API (p-API)
 - Morality API (m-API)
 - Empathy API (e-API)
 - Courage API (c-API)
 - Skepticism API (s-API)
